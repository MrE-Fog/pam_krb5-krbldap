.TH pam_krb5afs 5 2000/10/18 "Red Hat Linux" "System Administrator's Manual"
.SH NAME
pam_krb5afs \- Kerberos 5 authentication with AFS support
.SH DESCRIPTION
pam_krb5afs.so uses a portion of \fBkrb5.conf\fR to get its configuration
information.  You should read the \fBkrb5.conf(5)\fR man page before continuing
here.  The module expects its configuration information to be in the \fBpam\fR
section of the \fBkrb5.conf\fR configuration file.

.SH DIRECTIVES
.IP debug
can be set to \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR
turns on debugging via \fBsyslog(3)\fR.
.IP ticket_lifetime
default ticket lifetime.  If not specified, the default is 36000 seconds (10
hours).
.IP renew_lifetime
default renewable lifetime.  This specifies how much time you have after
getting credentials to renew them.  If not specified, the default is 36000
seconds (10 hours).
.IP forwardable
controls whether or not credentials are forwardable.  If not specified, they
are.
.IP krb4_convert
controls whether or not pam_krb5 tries to get Kerberos IV credentials from the
KC (or using the \fBkrb524d\fR service on the KDC) and create ticket files with
them.  Unless you've converted \fIeverything\fR on your network over to use
Kerberos 5, you'll want to leave this set to \fBtrue\fR.
.IP afs_cells
specifies which cells you want to get tokens for.  Set this to the list of all
of your local cells.
.IP hosts
specifies which other hosts credentials obtained by pam_krb5afs will be good on.
If your host is behind a firewall, you should add the IP address or name that
the \fIKDC\fR sees it as to this list.
.IP required_tgs
specifies a principal for which a user must be able to get a key for for
the purpose of verifying that the TGT has not been forged.  The key is
decrypted using a copy of the service's key stored in a local keytab file.
This is the only certain way to be absolutely sure the TGT hasn't been forged.
.IP keytab
specifies the name of a keytab file to find a key for the \fBrequired_tgs\fP in,
for use in verifying TGTs.  The default is \fB/etc/krb5.keytab\fP.
.IP ccache_dir
specifies the directory to place credential cache files in.  The default is
\fB/tmp\fR.
.IP banner
specifies what kind of password the module claims to be changing when called
to change passwords.  The default is \fBKerberos 5\fP.
