This module for Linux-PAM implements Kerberos 5 password-checking with
optional Kerberos 4 compatible ticket files and and aklog-style AFS
token-grabbing.  The pam_krb5 module is always built, and when compiled
on a system with libkrbafs installed, pam_krb5afs.so will also be built.

It implements authentication, session management, and password-changing
functions.  Sample configuration files for many services are included.

The pam_sm_authenticate() function checks the user name and password in
the user's realm.  It takes the standard parameters required by the PAM
documentation, as well as a few others listed below.

With no arguments, the pam_sm_authenticate() function defaults to
"try_first_pass" mode.  The TGT obtained and is saved for later use by
the pam_sm_setcred() function, but the TGT is NOT stored on disk.  The
new TGT is verified using a copy of the key for the local workstation's
host service if it is found in the local keytab file.

The pam_sm_setcred() function creates a Kerberos 5 ticket file and, if
libkrb524 was found at compile-time, can obtain and create a Kerberos 4
ticket file using the krb524 service running on the KDC.  If libkrbafs
was found at compile-time, the krb5afs module will also create a PAG
and get tokens for AFS cells specified in the configuration file.

The session management functions (pam_sm_open_session() and
pam_sm_close_session()) merely wrap calls to pam_setcred with the
PAM_ESTABLISH_CREDS and PAM_DELETE_CREDS flags, respectively, which is
handy because on my test box some things just don't work right.

Because session-specific ticket files require that the KRBTKFILE and
KRB5CCNAME environment variables are set correctly, certain programs that
create their own environments but don't incorporate the results of
pam_getenvlist() will work, but a user running 'klist' will think that
she has no tickets.  Currently, this includes ssh (openssh works) and
unpatched versions of every display manager known except gdm2 and newer.

Certain settings for the module are now stored in the krb5.conf file, which
is usually stored in /etc.  The section name is "pam":

[pam]
   debug = true
   ticket_lifetime = 36000
   renew_lifetime = 36000
   forwardable = true
   krb4_convert = true
   afs_cells = eos.ncsu.edu unity.ncsu.edu bp.ncsu.edu
   hosts = thermo.stat.ncsu.edu alf.physics.ncsu.edu

Descriptions of the configuration file directives read by both modules:
   debug		Gratuitous debugging info via syslog.
   ticket_lifetime	How long tickets are good, in seconds.  The default
  			is 36000 (= 10 hours).
   renew_lifetime	How long tickets are renewable, in seconds.  The
   			default is also 36000 (10 hours).
   forwardable		Whether or not tickets are forwardable.  Default = true.
   krb4_convert		Get krb4 tickets by talking to krb524d on the KDC.
   afs_cells		Cells to get tokens in.  Requires that krb4_convert be
			set.  Default as distributed is "eos unity bp".  Note
			that this is only supported by the pam_krb5afs module.
   hosts		Hosts this ticket will also be good for, in addition to
			this one.  Primarily for use behind firewalls.
   ccache_dir		The directory to store ccache files in.  The default is
			to use /tmp, but some people prefer /var/tmp.
   banner		What the module should announce itself as when changing
			passwords.  Defaults to "Kerberos 5".
   keytab		The name of a keytab file to use for TGT verification.
			The default is "/etc/krb5.keytab".
   required_tgs		The name of a service principal (with its key in the
			given keytab file) which is to be used to verify TGTs.
			The default is "host/<hostname>".

Descriptions of configuration directives for use in /etc/pam.d:
   use_first_pass	Use password obtained by a previous module.
   try_first_pass	Same as above, but prompt for another one to try the
			one used by the other module fails.
   skip_first_pass	Skip trying previously-entered password altogether.
   no_user_check	Don't check if the user has a local account, and let
			the current process's UID own any ccache files that get
			created.
   debug		Switch on debugging via syslog.
   tokens		Get tokens during authentication.  Needed for wu-ftpd,
			Samba, and some other programs that don't use sessions
			and don't call pam_setcred, but need tokens.  Note
                        that this is only supported by the pam_krb5afs module.
   use_authtok		Rely on tokens input by a previous module in the stack
			when changing passwords.  Primarily used if you're using
			pam_cracklib to screen out weak passwords.
   no_user_check	Don't bother checking if the login account corresponding
			to the principal exists or not, and use UID the service
			is executing under as the owner for any ccache files
			which get created.
   no_warn		Ignored.

This module was built and tested against MIT Kerberos 5 v1.2.1, but it should
only require v1.1.x.

Caveat: pam_pwdb will cause things to fail if your user information isn't stored
in one of the databases it knows about (i.e., hesiod).  Switch to pam_unix if
that happens.

Let me know if you have problems,
