- 2.2: * refreshing of preexisting credentials works, so unlocking your
         screensaver should fetch new credentials and tokens.  Be careful that
         you don't invoke the authentication function with the "tokens" flag,
         which creates a new PAG, if you want this to be useful.
	 As of this writing, at least xscreensaver calls pam_setcred() with the
	 proper flag to signal that credentials should be refreshed.  Other
	 screen saver applications may not.
       * new "external" option for use with OpenSSH's GSSAPI authentication
         with credential delegation and AFS, *should* work with anything which
         uses GSSAPI, accepts delegated credentials, and sets KRB5CCNAME in
	 the PAM environment
       * new "use_shmem" option for use with OpenSSH's privilege separation mode
       * credential and renewal lifetimes can now be given either as krb5-style
         times or as numbers of seconds
       * new "ignore_unknown_principal"/"ignore_unknown_spn" option
       * new "krb4_convert_524" option
       * configure can now set the default location of the system keytab
       * configure disables AFS support except on Linux (for now), but can
         be overridden either way
       * can now specify a principal name for AFS cells, to save guesswork
       * should now correctly work with SAM authentication, needs testing
- 2.1: switch to a minikafs implementation to flush out lurking ABI differences
  between the krb4 interface the kafs library used and the one which libkrb4
  provides.  Also, we support "2b" tokens now.
- 2.0: more or less complete rewrite.
  Jettison our own krb5.conf parsing code in favor of the supported API.
  This means that configuration settings which look like this:
  [pam]
    forwardable = yes
  are no longer recognized, and must be changed to:
  [appdefaults]
    pam = {
      forwardable = yes
    }
