.SH NAME
pam_krb5 \- Kerberos 5 authentication

.SH DESCRIPTION
pam_krb5.so reads its configuration information from the \fBappdefaults\fP
section of \fBkrb5.conf\fR(5).  You should read the \fBkrb5.conf(5)\fR man page
before continuing here.  The module expects its configuration information to be
in the \fB@PAM_KRB5_APPNAME@\fR subsection of the \fBappdefaults\fP section.

.SH DIRECTIVES
.IP debug=[\fItrue\fP|\fIfalse\fP]
turns on debugging via \fBsyslog(3)\fR.  Debug messages are logged with
priority \fILOG_DEBUG\fP.

.IP addressless=[\fItrue\fP|\fIfalse\fP]
if set, requests a TGT with no address information.  This can be necessary
if you are using Kerberos through a NAT, or on systems whose IP addresses change
regularly.  This directive is deprecated in favor of the \fBlibdefaults\fP
\fBnoaddresses\fP directive.

.IP banner=\fIKerberos 5\fP
specifies what sort of password the module claims to be changing whenever it is
called upon to change passwords.  The default is \fBKerberos 5\fP.

.IP ccache_dir=\fI@default_ccache_dir@\fP
specifies the directory to place credential cache files in.

.IP forwardable=[\fItrue\fP|\fIfalse\fP]
controls whether or not credentials are forwardable.  
This directive is deprecated in favor of the \fBlibdefaults\fP
\fBforwardable\fP directive.

.IP hosts=\fIhostnames\fP
specifies which other hosts credentials obtained by pam_krb5 will be good on.
If your host is behind a firewall, you should add the IP address or name that
the \fIKDC\fR sees it as to this list.
This directive is deprecated in favor of the \fBlibdefaults\fP
\fBextra_addresses\fP directive.

.IP keytab=\fI/etc/krb5.keytab\fP
specifies the name of a keytab file to search for a service key
for use in validating TGTs.

.IP krb4_convert=[\fItrue\fP|\fIfalse\fP]
controls whether or not pam_krb5 tries to get Kerberos IV credentials from the
KDC (or using the \fBkrb524d\fR service on the KDC) and create ticket files with
them.  Unless you've converted \fIeverything\fR on your network over to use
Kerberos 5, you'll want to leave this set to \fBtrue\fR.  Note that this
may require valid Kerberos IV configuration data to be present in
\fB/etc/krb.conf\fP and \fB/etc/krb.realms\fP.

.IP minimum_uid=\fI0\fP
specifies the minimum UID of users being authenticated.  If a user with a UID
less than this value attempts authentication, the request will be ignored.

.IP proxiable=[\fItrue\fP|\fIfalse\fP]
controls whether or not credentials are proxiable.  If not specified, they
are.
This directive is deprecated in favor of the \fBlibdefaults\fP
\fBproxiable\fP directive.

.IP renew_lifetime=\fI36000\fP
default renewable lifetime.  This specifies how much time you have after
getting credentials to renew them.
This directive is deprecated in favor of the \fBlibdefaults\fP
\fBrenew_lifetime\fP directive.

.IP ticket_lifetime=\fI36000\fP
default credential lifetime.

.IP validate=[\fItrue\fP|\fIfalse\fP]
specifies whether or not to attempt validation of the TGT.  The default is
\fBfalse\fP.

.SH EXAMPLE

  pam = {
    ticket_lifetime = 36000
    renew_lifetime = 36000
    forwardable = true
    krb4_convert = true
    validate = true
    ccache_dir = /var/tmp
    TEST.EXAMPLE.COM = {
      debug = true
