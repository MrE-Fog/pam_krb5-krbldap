.SH NAME
pam_krb5 \- Kerberos 5 authentication

.SH DESCRIPTION
pam_krb5.so reads its configuration information from the \fBappdefaults\fP
section of \fBkrb5.conf\fP(5).  You should read the \fBkrb5.conf(5)\fP man page
before continuing here.  The module expects its configuration information to be
in the \fB@PAM_KRB5_APPNAME@\fP subsection of the \fBappdefaults\fP section.

.SH DIRECTIVES
.IP debug=[\fItrue\fP|\fIfalse\fP]
turns on debugging via \fBsyslog(3)\fP.  Debug messages are logged with
priority \fILOG_DEBUG\fP.

.IP addressless=[\fItrue\fP|\fIfalse\fP]
if set, requests a TGT with no address information.  This can be necessary
if you are using Kerberos through a NAT, or on systems whose IP addresses change
regularly.  This directive is deprecated in favor of the \fBlibdefaults\fP
\fBnoaddresses\fP directive.

.IP afs_cells=\fIcell1.example.com cell2.example.com\fP
tells pam_krb5.so to obtain tokens for cell1.example.com and cell2.example.com,
in addition to the local cell and the cell which contains the user's home
directory, for the user.

.IP banner=\fIKerberos 5\fP
specifies what sort of password the module claims to be changing whenever it is
called upon to change passwords.  The default is \fBKerberos 5\fP.

.IP ccache_dir=\fI@default_ccache_dir@\fP
specifies the directory to place credential cache files in.

.IP external=\fItrue\fP
.IP external=\fIsshd ftp\fP
tells pam_krb5.so to use Kerberos credentials provided by the calling
application during session setup.  This is most often useful for obtaining
AFS tokens or a krb4 ticket.

.IP forwardable=[\fItrue\fP|\fIfalse\fP]
controls whether or not credentials are forwardable.  
This directive is deprecated in favor of the \fBlibdefaults\fP
\fBforwardable\fP directive.

.IP hosts=\fIhostnames\fP
specifies which other hosts credentials obtained by pam_krb5 will be good on.
If your host is behind a firewall, you should add the IP address or name that
the \fIKDC\fP sees it as to this list.
This directive is deprecated in favor of the \fBlibdefaults\fP
\fBextra_addresses\fP directive.

.IP initial_prompt=[\fItrue\fP|\fIfalse\fP]
tells pam_krb5.so whether or not to ask for a password before attempting
authentication.  If one is needed and pam_krb5.so has not prompted for it,
the Kerberos library should trigger a request for a password.

.IP keytab=\fI@DEFAULT_KEYTAB@\fP
specifies the name of a keytab file to search for a service key
for use in validating TGTs.

.IP krb4_convert=[\fItrue\fP|\fIfalse\fP]
controls whether or not pam_krb5 tries to get Kerberos IV credentials from the
KDC (or using the \fBkrb524d\fP service on the KDC) and create ticket files with
them.  Unless you've converted \fIeverything\fP on your network over to use
Kerberos 5, you'll want to leave this set to \fBtrue\fP.  Note that this
may require valid Kerberos IV configuration data to be present in
\fB/etc/krb.conf\fP and \fB/etc/krb.realms\fP.

.IP mappings=[\fIregex1 regex2\fP]
specifies that pam_krb5 should derive the user's principal name from the Unix
user name by first checking if the user name matches \fBregex1\fP, and
formulating a principal name using \fBregex2\fP.  For example,
\fBmappings = EXAMPLE\\(.*) $1@EXAMPLE.COM\fP
would map any user with a name of the form "EXAMPLE\whatever" to a principal
name of "whatever@EXAMPLE.COM".  This is primarily targeted at allowing
pam_krb5 to be used to authenticate users whose user information is provided by
winbindd(8).  This will frequently require the reverse to be configured by
setting up an auth_to_local rule elsewhere in krb5.conf(5).

.IP minimum_uid=\fI0\fP
specifies the minimum UID of users being authenticated.  If a user with a UID
less than this value attempts authentication, the request will be ignored.

.IP proxiable=[\fItrue\fP|\fIfalse\fP]
controls whether or not credentials are proxiable.  If not specified, they
are.
This directive is deprecated in favor of the \fBlibdefaults\fP
\fBproxiable\fP directive.

.IP renew_lifetime=\fI36000\fP
default renewable lifetime.  This specifies how much time you have after
getting credentials to renew them.
This directive is deprecated in favor of the \fBlibdefaults\fP
\fBrenew_lifetime\fP directive.

.IP ticket_lifetime=\fI36000\fP
default credential lifetime.

.IP tokens
signals that pam_krb5.so should create an AFS PAG and obtain tokens during
authentication in addition to session setup.  This is primarily useful in
server applications which need to access a user's files but which do not open
PAM sessions before doing so.

.IP use_shmem=\fItrue\fP
.IP use_shmem=\fIsshd ftp\fP
tells pam_krb5.so to pass credentials from the authentication service function
to the session management service function using shared memory for specific
services.

.IP validate=[\fItrue\fP|\fIfalse\fP]
specifies whether or not to attempt validation of the TGT.  The default is
\fBfalse\fP.
