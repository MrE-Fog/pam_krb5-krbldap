2005-03-04:
	* configure.ac: remove -Wno-unused-parameters from the set of extra
	warning flags.  Add a newline after inclusion of <krb5.h> when we're
	testing for structures defined in the krb5 API.
	* src/sly.c: compile in a dummy sly_v4() if USE_KRB4 isn't defined
	* src/v4.h: don't provide prototypes if USE_KRB4 isn't defined.

2005-02-28:
	* configure.in: demote -Wextra and friends --enable-extra-warnings
	status.

2005-02-28:
	* src/minikafs.c: fix compilation against releases which didn't define
	KRB_TICKET_GRANTING_TICKET.
	* src/pagsh.c: add missing <stdio.h> inclusion.
	* src/minikafs.c: handle cases where krb_life_to_time() isn't available.
	* src/pagsh.c: add a --help flag, by assuming that the command will
	never start with "-".

2005-02-24 nalin
	* src/logstdio.c: add a log_progname global to adjust log messages.
	* src/afs5log.c,src/harness.c: set log_progname at startup.
	* src/prompter.c: suppress prompts for the previously-entered password.
	* src/userinfo.c: clean up some valgrind-caught weirdness.
	* src/harness.c: use getpass() instead of fgets() for
	PAM_PROMPT_ECHO_OFF prompts.  Kids, don't try that at home.
	* src/sly.c: only refresh the default krb5 ccache if its principal is
	the one we've authenticated.
	* src/tokens.c: log a debug message if we create a new PAG.  When
	determining the user's home cell, if the user's home directory is a
	symlink, chase it.
2005-02-24 nalin
	* configure.ac: add a --enable-default-keytab-location flag.
	* src/options.c,src/pam_krb5.5.in,src/pam_krb5.8.in: obey it.
	* README: document that it can be overridden.  (Don't want to change
	this to README.in to actually reflect that override value.)
	* src/v4.c(v4_get_creds): error out if password is NULL or zero-length.
	* src/v5.c(v5_get_creds): provide the prompter callback to libkrb5.
	* src/options.c: add an "initial_prompt"/"no_initial_prompt" option
	which suppresses the initial password prompt.  It's useless for
	providing a PAM_AUTHTOK to subsequent modules, but is useful now that
	we're providing a prompter callback to libkrb5.
	* src/auth.c: handle no_initial_prompt cases.  Get AFS tokens if the
	saved password turned out to be correct.
	* src/log.c: fix a few memory leaks.
	* src/harness.c: add, to make debugging easier.
2005-02-23 nalin
	* src/init.c: don't call initialize_krb5_error_table; this currently
	leads to a crash due to libkrb5 from MIT's 1.4 release making an
	invalid assumption about e2fsprogs 1.36's libcom_err (SF #1150146)
2005-02-14 nalin
	* src/stash.c,src/stash.h: add a field to the stash structure for
	keeping of whether or not we set the KRB5CCNAME/KRBTKFILE environment
	variables
	* src/session.c: clear KRB5CCNAME/KRBTKFILE if we're removing the
	files *and* we set the variables.  Treat zero-length values as we
	treate NULL values for those variables.
2005-02-08 nalin
	* src/afs5log.c: properly screen out "dynroot" as a cell name, walk up
	from the user's home directory if we can't determine in which cell it
	is that it resides

2005-02-08 nalin
	* src/acct.c: treat a KRB5KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_FAILED error as if it were
	a KRB5KRB_AP_ERR_BAD_INTEGRITY error.
	* README,src/pam_krb5.5.in,src/pam_krb5.8.in: doc updates.

2005-02-08 nalin
	* src/userinfo.c,src/userinfo.h: look up and make note of the user's
	home directory.
	* src/tokens.c(tokens_obtain): attempt to determine the cell in which
	the user's home directory resides, and default to obtaining tokens for
	that cell as well, unless it's the same as the default cell.  Skip
	cells given to the afs_cells option if they are the same as either the
	local cell or the user's home cell.
	* src/options.c: handle "external" like we handle "use_shmem".
	* src/stash.c: read a krbtgt key from $KRB5CCNAME if "external" was
	set.  Try to reuse the passed-in krb5_context, if possible.
	* src/session.c: don't create new ccache or ticket files if KRB5CCNAME
	or KRBTKFILE are already set in the PAM environment, respectively.

2005-02-07 nalin
	* src/minikafs.c(minikafs_5log): initialize use_ccache as a handle for
	the default cred cache, not ccache, when ccache is NULL.
	* src/options.c(option_t): add, for parsing a value as a krb5_deltat if
	it can't be parsed as a normal integer.
	* src/options.h: change normal and renewable lifetimes to krb5_deltat
	* src/options.c(_pam_krb5_options_init): parse lifetimes using option_t
	instead of option_i.
	* src/*.c: random signed/unsigned warning corrections.

2004-09-13 nalin
	* src/tokens.c: skip getting tokens for the cell of /afs if that cell
	is "dynroot", which is what OpenAFS's dynamic-root support gives us.
	* src/auth.c: run the krb5_kuserok() check in the authentication phase
	as well (Douglas E. Engert).

2004-09-02 nalin
	* src/minikafs.c: add copyright statement because the ioctl patch is
	too much like heimdal's implementation.

2004-08-31 nalin
	* src/shmem.c,src/shmem.h: add, several functions for handling shared
	memory.
	* src/auth.c:(pam_sm_authenticate): log the realm as well. store
	credentials to shared memory on success if the "use_shmem" flag was
	given, or if "use_shmem=" lists the current service, or is true.
	* src/stash.c:(_pam_krb5_stash_shm_read,_pam_krb5_stash_shm_write): add.
	* src/storetmp.c(_pam_krb5_read_with_retry): make non-static.
	* src/storetmp.c(_pam_krb5_storetmp_file): add a hook for storing a copy
	of the file contents in a blob of memory.

2004-08-31 nalin
	* src/password.c(pam_sm_chauthtok): during the preliminary check phase,
	read the current password as the PAM_OLDAUTHTOK item, not PAM_AUTHTOK
	(Ludek Finstrle, #131246)

2004-08-27 nalin
	* src/userinfo.c(_pam_krb5_user_info_init): override the realm name to
	be the one which was passed in (Carlos A. Villegas, #116198).

2004-08-27 nalin
	* src/minikafs.c: handle cases where the length of the realm name >
	length of the cell name.

2004-08-27 nalin
	* src/options.c(_pam_krb5_options_init): set the default realm for
	ctx (#116198).

2004-08-26 nalin
	* src/options.h,options.c: add an ignore_afs flag to the options
	structure, heavily based on Matthew Miller's patch (#126345).
	* auth.c, session.c, sly.c: obey ignore_afs.

2004-08-26 nalin
	* src/acct.c(pam_sm_acct_mgmt): skip .k5login check of user_check was
	disabled -- it's not as if we can expect an unknown user to have a home
	directory.

2004-08-26 nalin
	* src/conv.c(_pam_krb5_conv_call): return PAM_BAD_ITEM instead of
	PAM_CONV_ERR if the application didn't define a conversation function.

2004-08-26 nalin
	* src/minikafs.c(minikafs_ioctlcall): add, from Alexander Boström
	(#127529).
	* src/minikafs.c(minikafs_call): add, calling afs_ioctlcall or
	afs_syscall as appropriate, from Alexander Boström (#127529).  The
	setpag and pioctl functions now call this function instead of our
	afs_syscall.
	* src/minikafs.c(minikafs_has_afs): check for ioctl-based interface to
	Arla or OpenAFS for Linux 2.6, from Alexander Boström (#127529).

2004-08-26 nalin
	* src/password.c(pam_sm_chauthtok): prompt for the user's current
	password when use_first_pass isn't flagged, ignoring use_authtok
	during the initial-authentication pass (#130950).

2004-06-14 nalin
	* src/session.c(pam_sm_open_session,pam_sm_close_session): log what
	we return, and why, if debugging is enabled.

2004-06-14 nalin
	* src/acct.c(pam_sm_acct_mgmt): likewise, catch and log specific error
	information for EAGAIN, KRB5_REALM_CANT_RESOLVE, and KRB5_KDC_UNREACH
	errors.

2004-06-14 nalin
	* src/v5.c(v5_get_creds): return PAM_AUTHINFO_UNAVAIL if we got EAGAIN,
	which is triggered by a transient hostname resolution error (John
	Dennis).  Also do this for KRB5_REALM_CANT_RESOLVE and KRB5_KDC_UNREACH
	error cases.

2004-04-21 nalin
	* Makefile.am: make configure depend on pam_krb5.spec.

2004-04-21 nalin
	* src/minikafs.c: print debug messages when doing realmofcell stuff.

	* configure.ac: perform all checks for Kerberos functions with all of
	the libraries we've found.

2004-04-21 nalin
	* configure.ac: escape sed expressions correctly so that LDFLAGS doesn't
	include -l flags for Kerberos, skip all krb4 checks if --without-krb4
	is passed in.
	* src/Makefile.am: add KRB5_LIBS and KRB4_LIBS as needed.
	* src/minikafs.c: use krb524_convert_creds_kdc if krb5_524_convert_creds
	isn't available.  Force v5 mode on if USE_KRB4 is not defined.

2004-04-21 nalin
	* configure.ac: search for PAM libraries separately
	* src/Makefile.am: use a convenience library to compile code only once
	* src/afs5log.c: supply a non-bogus ccache and options argument to
	minikafs, provide local logging functions which use stdio.

2004-04-15 nalin
	* configure.ac: default krb5-config and krb4-config to ':', add non
	library arguments output by --libs to LIBS
	* src/minikafs.c: add missing <stdio.h> include.
	* src/stash.c: fix compile for non-USE_KRB4 case.
	* src/v4.c: fix compile for non-USE_KRB4 case.

	* src/v5.c(v5_creds_key_length): add.
	* src/v5.c(v5_creds_key_contents): add.

2004-03-23 nalin
	* configure.ac: remove kafs/krbafs checks.
	* src/Makefile.am: add EXTRA_PROGRAMS target for afs5log.
	* src/afs5log.c: add a test program for exercising minikafs.

	krbafs implementation.
	* src/options.c(_pam_krb5_options_init): distinguish between v4 for
	general use and v4 because we're using AFS.

2004-03-16 nalin
	* src/pam_krb5_storetmp.c: remove the file if it's not a valid mkstemp
	pattern, even if we were passed a UID/GID.

2004-03-16 nalin
	* src/storetmp.c: drop privileges before we exec the helper.

2004-03-16 nalin
	* src/pam_krb5_storetmp.c: only attempt to change to the required
	UID/GID if we are not already running with that UID/GID, and only
	attempt to clear the supplemental groups list if uid == 0 (we're root).

2004-03-16 nalin
	* src/session.c: remove explict calls to chown(), which would be denied
	by SELinux in enforcing mode, instead expecting the helper to handle it
	all.
	* src/v5.c: remove explict calls to chown(), which would be denied by
	SELinux in enforcing mode, instead expecting the helper to handle it
	all.

	SELinux in enforcing mode, instead expecting the helper to handle it
	all.
	* src/storetmp.c: pass the user's uid and gid to the helper, it already
	knows what to do.
	* src/tokens.c(tokens_useful): add.
	* src/session.c: when opening a session, create temporary tickets for
	grabbing tokens with the current permissions so that libkrb4 doesn't
	reject them, then clean them up, then create those for the user.

2004-03-10 nalin
	* src/pam_krb5_storetmp.c: if the filename pattern supplied is not a
	valid pattern (does not end with XXXXXX), delete the file instead,
	reporting success in the same way.
	* src/session.c(pam_sm_close_session): note ticket file deletions when
	debugging.
	* src/storetmp.c(_pam_krb5_storetmp_delete): add, to invoke the helper

	files have non-zero-length filenames.

2004-02-27 nalin
	* src/storetmp.c(_pam_krb5_storetmp_data): open /dev/null three times to
	ensure that pipe() won't give us any stdio descriptors.  Reintroduce the
	call to execl() which got dropped earlier.

2004-02-27 nalin
	* src/pam_krb5_storetmp.c: add this helper, which creates a file using
	mkstemp, filling it with supplied data.
	* src/storetmp.c: add routines for using pam_krb5_storetmp to create

2003-11-25 nalin
	* README: updates

2003-11-20 nalin
	* src/userinfo.c, src/userinfo.h: when setting things up for a user,
	obey "mappings" settings.  Because we can't be certain that the
	generated principal will pass through aname_to_lname correctly, don't
	do that any more.

2003-11-20 nalin
	* src/initopts.c(_pam_krb5_set_init_opts): set the ticket lifetime,
	if configured, as an initopt.  This change lets us fix #109331.

2003-11-20 nalin
	* src/options.c, src/options.h: add code for parsing a "mappings"
	setting.  Reintroduce ticket_lifetime, which I mistakenly thought was
	a libdefault setting now.

2003-11-20 nalin
	* src/map.c, src/map.h: add mapping functions which mimic OpenLDAP's
	saslRegexp functionality for mapping local user names to principal
	names.

2003-11-20 nalin
	* src/init.c: instead of forcing the realm when parsing principals,
	make realm= set the default realm.

2003-11-19 nalin
	* src/v5.c(v5_get_creds): use the realm from the unparsed version of
	the principal name when constructing service principals.

2003-09-22 nalin
	* src/session.c: actually return where we were supposed to return.

2003-09-19 nalin
	* src/session.c: if v5attempted is 0 or v5result is not 0, don't
	mess with tokens or credentials.  This allows apps which change their
	UIDs to keep tokens unless they obtained some of their own.
	* src/auth.c: before attempting authentication, reset v5attempted so
	that we don't count a previous authentication failure as a failure
	forever.
	* src/acct.c: if v5attempted is not set in the user's stash, attempt
	to get initial credentials for the user.  If the password check fails,
	assume the user name is valid.

2003-09-05 nalin
	* src/stash.h: add a v5attempted field to track whether or not we've
	attempted to get v5 creds for this user. add an afspag field to track
	whether or not we've created an afs PAG.
	* src/stash.c: initialize v5attempted and other fields, even if it's
	redundant after using memset to clear the whole structure.
	* src/auth.c: set v5attempted in the user's stash immediately after
	all calls to v5_get_creds.
	* src/acct.c: if v5attempted is not set in the user's stash, just
	return PAM_IGNORE.
	* src/tokens.c: only delete tokens on session close if we created a
	pag, lest we lose tokens when reverting back in su.  Only warn about
	errors getting tokens if v5attempted was set (else these become debug
	messages).
	* src/pam_krb5.8.in: note the behavior of the module in acct stacks.

2003-09-05 nalin
	* configure.ac: check for krb_time_to_life.
	* src/v4.c: use krb_time_to_life to convert lifetimes from seconds to
	bytes, not krb_life_to_time, which does the opposite.

2003-08-14 nalin
	* configure.ac: check for __posix_getpwnam_r.
	* src/userinfo.c(get_pw): use __posix_getpwnam_r if it is available and
	getpwnam_r isn't available

2003-08-14 nalin
	* src/session.c(pam_close_session), src/sly.c: return PAM_USER_UNKNOWN
	instead of PAM_SERVICE_ERR if we fail to get information about the user.

2003-08-14 nalin
	* src/auth.c(pam_sm_authenticate): log the PAM error code we're
	returning if we're returning a failure after all attempts have been
	made.  Save the password entered by the user in the normal we-prompted
	case.
	* pam_krb5.spec: bump version to 2.0.1

2003-08-14 nalin
	* src/auth.c, src/acct.c, src/session.c(pam_open_session),
	src/password.c: return PAM_USER_UNKNOWN instead of PAM_SERVICE_ERR if
	we fail to get information about the user.
	
2003-08-14 nalin
	* tests/run-tests: leave some time between expiring of passwords and
	attempts to check if they've truly been expired, in case the server
	implementation considers expiration time to be the end of the second
	instead of the start

2003-08-13 nalin
	* src/xstr.c, src/xstr.h: add xstrfree().
	* src/auth.c, src/options.c, src/password.c, src/prompter.c,
	src/stash.c, src/userinfo.c, src/v4.c, src/v5.c: use xstrfree() to
	free strings.
