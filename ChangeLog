2003-11-20 nalin
	* src/map.c, src/map.h: add mapping functions which mimic OpenLDAP's
	saslRegexp functionality for mapping local user names to principal
	names.

2003-11-20 nalin
	* src/init.c: instead of forcing the realm when parsing principals,
	make realm= set the default realm.

2003-11-19 nalin
	* src/v5.c(v5_get_creds): use the realm from the unparsed version of
	the principal name when constructing service principals.

2003-09-22 nalin
	* src/session.c: actually return where we were supposed to return.

2003-09-19 nalin
	* src/session.c: if v5attempted is 0 or v5result is not 0, don't
	mess with tokens or credentials.  This allows apps which change their
	UIDs to keep tokens unless they obtained some of their own.
	* src/auth.c: before attempting authentication, reset v5attempted so
	that we don't count a previous authentication failure as a failure
	forever.
	* src/acct.c: if v5attempted is not set in the user's stash, attempt
	to get initial credentials for the user.  If the password check fails,
	assume the user name is valid.

2003-09-05 nalin
	* src/stash.h: add a v5attempted field to track whether or not we've
	attempted to get v5 creds for this user. add an afspag field to track
	whether or not we've created an afs PAG.
	* src/stash.c: initialize v5attempted and other fields, even if it's
	redundant after using memset to clear the whole structure.
	* src/auth.c: set v5attempted in the user's stash immediately after
	all calls to v5_get_creds.
	* src/acct.c: if v5attempted is not set in the user's stash, just
	return PAM_IGNORE.
	* src/tokens.c: only delete tokens on session close if we created a
	pag, lest we lose tokens when reverting back in su.  Only warn about
	errors getting tokens if v5attempted was set (else these become debug
	messages).
	* src/pam_krb5.8.in: note the behavior of the module in acct stacks.

2003-09-05 nalin
	* configure.ac: check for krb_time_to_life.
	* src/v4.c: use krb_time_to_life to convert lifetimes from seconds to
	bytes, not krb_life_to_time, which does the opposite.

2003-08-14 nalin
	* configure.ac: check for __posix_getpwnam_r.
	* src/userinfo.c(get_pw): use __posix_getpwnam_r if it is available and
	getpwnam_r isn't available

2003-08-14 nalin
	* src/session.c(pam_close_session), src/sly.c: return PAM_USER_UNKNOWN
	instead of PAM_SERVICE_ERR if we fail to get information about the user.

2003-08-14 nalin
	* src/auth.c(pam_sm_authenticate): log the PAM error code we're
	returning if we're returning a failure after all attempts have been
	made.  Save the password entered by the user in the normal we-prompted
	case.
	* pam_krb5.spec: bump version to 2.0.1

2003-08-14 nalin
	* src/auth.c, src/acct.c, src/session.c(pam_open_session),
	src/password.c: return PAM_USER_UNKNOWN instead of PAM_SERVICE_ERR if
	we fail to get information about the user.
	
2003-08-14 nalin
	* tests/run-tests: leave some time between expiring of passwords and
	attempts to check if they've truly been expired, in case the server
	implementation considers expiration time to be the end of the second
	instead of the start

2003-08-13 nalin
	* src/xstr.c, src/xstr.h: add xstrfree().
	* src/auth.c, src/options.c, src/password.c, src/prompter.c,
	src/stash.c, src/userinfo.c, src/v4.c, src/v5.c: use xstrfree() to
	free strings.

- Don't link pam_krb5 with libkrbafs.

  changing service ticket (noted, and fix supplied, by Onime Clement).
