For 2.2.0:
- Luke Howard sent me the diff for the changes he's included for XAD.  Some
  of it's been integrated, other hard-code changes are now compile-time
  options.  Double-check that I haven't missed anything.
- Make sure the password-changing fixes Michael Calmer sent in are properly
  integrated.
Longer term (2.3?):
- Figure out how mappings should work with
  krb5_aname_to_localname
  krb5_kuserok
- Check if krb5_cc_gen_new() is really a better way to go when generating
  session credential caches.
- See where the kernel keyring / ccache stuff is and what needs to be done
  to set that up.
