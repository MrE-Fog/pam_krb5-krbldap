* Maybe use krb5_aname_to_localname to do principal/login mapping?
* Ensure we're compliant with the PAM docs wrt return values.  It's not the
  RFC, but it's something.
* Add support for account expiration.  (Isn't krb5_get_init_creds_password
  already taking care of this, though?)
* Make use of krb5_verify_init_creds() contingent on an autoconf check,
  instead of hard-coding our preference of it over the internal validate_tgt()
  function (for older versions of krb5).
