Soon:
- Set up tokens for use by rxk5-enabled cells.  Basically it's an XDR-encoded
  krb5_creds structure, but the code needs to be written.

Later:
- Figure out how mappings should work with
  krb5_aname_to_localname
  krb5_kuserok
- Check if krb5_cc_gen_new() is really a better way to go when generating
  session credential caches.
